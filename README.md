🏠 Hostel Allocation System Website

## Team Project — Hostel Allocation System

Description: This is a group project developed by three members to manage hostel allocations through a user-friendly web interface. The system is divided into three major parts: Login Page, Dashboard, and Logout Page.

🚪 My part in this project was to design and implement the Logout Page using HTML and CSS. This page ensures that the user ends the session securely and is redirected appropriately after logging out.

The Logout Page is kept simple and user-friendly with confirmation and redirection UI.
